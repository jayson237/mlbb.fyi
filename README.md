## Features ‚≠ê

# User Account Authentication

**[PROPOSED]**

As an integral part of mlbb.fyi, a community-based website that focuses on Mobile Legends, user authentication is crucial to ensure the security and privacy of each individual's personal profile and Mobile Legends account. To achieve this, mlbb.fyi has implemented three sign-in methods: email, sign in via Google, and sign in via GitHub.

mlbb.fyi will implement 3 sign-in methods:

1. Sign in via **Email**
2. Sign in via **Google**
3. Sign in via **GitHub**

To facilitate the authentication process and enhance security, mlbb.fyi leverages the capabilities of MongoDB, a widely used NoSQL database system. By utilizing MongoDB, the website can securely store user account information without directly inputting any passwords into its system. Instead, MongoDB allows for the secure storage and retrieval of user credentials through encrypted methods. This approach helps safeguard sensitive user information and minimizes the risk of unauthorized access.

**[CURRENT PROGRESS]**

We have finished implementing signing in via email.
